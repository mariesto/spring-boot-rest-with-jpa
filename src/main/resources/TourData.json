    "description": "At Explore California, we strive to have all our tours be ecologically sound, by serving organic food, using low emissions vehicles, and working with small businesses, but this tour is designed specifically to explore why we take those measures. This 3-day trip has families in mind, but is great for any outdoor enthusiast/activist. The first day, you'll kayak the creeks surrounding Lake Casitas in Ventura County, all the way to the ocean. A victim of drought and mismanagement, it is now federally protected and you can watch it coming back to life. The first night will be spent at the Ojai Foundation, in your choice of a yurt or cabin. The second day is spent on an organic farm in Ojai, California, touring the grounds and learning about organic farming methods. Spend a night in town at a kid and pet friendly bed and breakfast. The third day, you'll travel up the coast to Santa Barbara to visit the botanical gardens and Natural History Museum and learn about California's endangered species. Before you leave, take a guided hiked of the foothills above the coast. If nothing else, the views will leave a lasting impression on you of just how valuable the environment is.",
